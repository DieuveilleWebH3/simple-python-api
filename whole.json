I\u2019m already peeing for the fourth time today.\r\n\r\nI peed when I woke up at 6:30 a.m. Then I drank a glass of water, had my habitual three cups of coffee, and peed a couple more times over the course of the next few hours. Now I\u2019m peeing again.\r\n\r\nMy urine is clear. (It\u2019s almost always clear.) If I drink another glass or two of water between now and lunchtime, and then five more glasses this afternoon and evening, I\u2019ll have hit the eight-glasses-per-day target that everyone seems to think is the key to health and hydration. I\u2019ll probably pee a dozen more times today.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, I thought I was doing everything right. Water, as the saying goes, is the essence of life. You need it or you die. And if there\u2019s one thing nutrition experts seem to agree on, it\u2019s that dehydration is bad and drinking lots of water is good.\r\n\r\nBut then I read this 2019 study in the journal Nutrients, which discusses the potential risks of overhydration. Its authors argue that drinking too much water is not only wasteful, but that over time it could lead to bladder distention, kidney dysfunction, or other problems. It cites case reports of otherwise healthy people who drank so much water that they developed swollen kidneys or ruptured urinary tracts.\r\n\r\n    The research on longevity and mortality is oddly silent on the subject of water consumption, and experts have called the search for a universal daily water requirement \u201celusive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUrine is a waste product that helps your body balance its levels of sodium and other electrolytes,\u201d says Tamara Hew-Butler, PhD, first author of that study and an associate professor of exercise physiology at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re peeing all the time and your pee is clear, she says, that\u2019s an indication that you\u2019re drinking more water than your body can use, and so you\u2019re forcing it to dump fluids in order to maintain homeostasis. While that\u2019s unlikely to be a problem in the short-term, keeping that up for years or decades could lead to some of the urinary tract problems outlined in her study.\r\n\r\nThe more I dug through the research, the more it seemed like she had a point.\r\n\r\nJust how much H2O do you need to drink each day for optimal health? The research on hydration is surprisingly inconsistent.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s the long-standing recommendation \u2014 sometimes called the eight-by-eight rule \u2014 to drink eight, eight-ounce glasses of water each day. But experts have not found solid scientific evidence to support this advice.\r\n\r\n\u201cSaying everyone needs eight glasses of water to be healthy is like saying everyone needs to eat a 2,000-calorie diet,\u201d Hew-Butler says. \u201cI weigh 90 pounds and I spend most of my day sitting inside, but I work with football players who weigh 300 pounds and are exercising all day. Our hydration needs are completely different.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe says the average person needs to replace roughly two liters (or eight cups) of lost fluid each day. But almost anything you drink or eat is going to contain water, which will offset that daily loss. \u201cCoffee, tea, soup, fruits, vegetables \u2014 all of that counts,\u201d she says. (Some work has found that people get an average of 20% of their daily fluids from food alone.)\r\n\r\n    After collecting samples from more than 300 college athletes, she and her colleagues found that up to 55% were dehydrated based on their pee, but none were dehydrated according to their blood samples.\r\n\r\nMajor health organizations also differ widely in their views on fluid requirements.\r\n\r\nThe European Food Safety Authority advises women and men to consume two liters and 2.5 liters per day, respectively. Meanwhile, the U.S. National Academy of Medicine recommends 2.7 liters for women and 3.5 for men \u2014 or roughly 35\u201340% more than their European counterparts. (And again, both organizations say that all foods and beverages \u2014 not just water \u2014 count toward these daily totals.)\r\n\r\nIt seems like the eight-glasses-a-day maxim has persisted in part because nothing compelling has come along to take its place. The research on longevity and mortality is oddly silent on the subject of water consumption, and experts have called the search for a universal daily water requirement \u201celusive.\u201d\r\n\r\nPart of the difficulty in assessing human hydration needs has to do with how dehydration is measured.\r\n\r\nAnother of Hew-Butler\u2019s studies found that urine-based hydration analyses \u2014 the most common type employed in research \u2014 often don\u2019t align with more accurate blood-based measurements. After collecting samples from more than 300 college athletes, she and her colleagues found that up to 55% were dehydrated based on their pee, but none were dehydrated according to their blood samples.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s been some well-publicized research showing that even mild dehydration can cause fatigue, headaches, moodiness, or cognitive impairments. But I was surprised to find criticisms of this work. A review in the journal Nutrients argued that these sorts of dehydration studies have produced inconsistent results, and that they often ask people to exercise in hot environments, which could induce fatigue or other symptoms for reasons that have nothing to do with dehydration. (I also found that a lot of dehydration studies have been led by researchers affiliated with Danone or other companies that sell bottled water.)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, research in the journal Nutrition Reviews has concluded that overhydration \u201cmay not be as benign as is usually assumed.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that dehydration is dangerous. Our thirst reflexes tend to decline as we age, and dehydration is a common and serious health problem among the elderly \u2014 one that can worsen a number of age-related medical conditions.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s also no question that drinking water is generally good for you, and that swigging it in place of sugar-sweetened beverages can reduce your risk for metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.\r\n\r\nBut if, like me, you assumed there\u2019s no downside to drinking lots of water \u2014 that going to the bathroom 15 times a day is a sign of proper hydration \u2014 the research to date doesn\u2019t endorse this view. It\u2019s possible that by flooding my digestive plumbing with unneeded H20, I may be asking for a swollen bladder, worn-out kidneys, or other urinary tract issues.\r\n\r\nFinally, there\u2019s the environmental cost of excessive water consumption.\r\n\r\nWater is a precious resource. Energy is needed to purify it so that it\u2019s potable. Many of us prefer our water bottled, and all that plastic adds up; the U.S. goes through 28 billion plastic water bottles a year. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about climate change, why would you drink more water than you need?\u201d Hew-Butler asks.\r\n\r\nShe recommends drinking water when you feel thirsty. \u201cListen to your body,\u201d she says. \u201cIt will tell you if you\u2019re drinking too little.\u201d If you notice your urine is dark yellow, that\u2019s also a good indicator that you need a drink.\r\n\r\nWater is good for you.

The debate \u2014 gaining fresh vigor in recent years with advances in understanding disease causes even while science still can\u2019t explain exactly why or how we age \u2014 is full of genuine scientific disagreement, laced with idealistic dreams of immortality, and loaded with ethical concerns.\r\n\r\nBiological aging is not just a source, but the source of many debilitating and deadly diseases, argues the Healthy Life Extension Society, led by Sven Bulterijs, a postgraduate researcher who studies the biology of aging at the University of Ghent in Belgium. \u201cThe only way to prevent these illnesses linked to aging is to attack the principal cause \u2014 aging itself,\u201d the group contends. \u201cIt is time to start working toward solutions to this universal human tragedy.\u201d\r\n\r\nThose bold assertions, particularly viewing aging as a tragedy, are not shared by the majority of aging experts.\r\n\r\n\u201cAging is a natural part of life for those who are lucky enough to live a long time,\u201d says Sharona Hoffman, JD, a professor of law and bioethics at Case Western Reserve University and author of the book, Aging With a Plan: How a Little Thought Today Can Vastly Improve Your Tomorrow. \u201cAging should not be considered a disease in and of itself.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe National Institute on Aging concurs, in what serves as an official scientific stance on the issue, a nuanced view that emphasizes the complex, two-way relationship between aging and illness: \u201cAging is not, in and of itself, a disease. However, aging is the major risk factor for developing many major chronic diseases. Furthermore, many diseases appear to accelerate the aging process \u2014 which is manifested as declines in functionality and reduced quality of life.\u201d\r\nWhat is disease, anyway?\r\n\r\nAmong the many loose ends driving this debate is the startling fact that there is no universal, formal medical description for the word \u201cdisease.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines \u201chealth\u201d as \u201ca state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\u201d Yet disease is sometimes defined, if at all, only as being the opposite of health. Or it\u2019s defined rather succinctly yet imprecisely as \u201cillness or sickness characterized by specific signs and symptoms.\u201d\r\n\r\nScientists sometimes refer to disease simply as an unwanted or harmful deviation from the norm.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the list of maladies that are considered diseases is fluid, illustrating ongoing challenges to conventional medical wisdom. Osteoporosis didn\u2019t used to be on the list, but now it is. Homosexuality was on the list, and now it\u2019s not. Whether obesity should be considered a disease is in the midst of its own hot debate.\r\nThe argument for defining aging as a disease\r\n\r\nThe case for characterizing biological aging as a disease argues, in part, that the physical decline that typically comes with chronological aging is harmful and unwanted, just like a disease, and there are specific signs and symptoms attributable to aging, Bulterijs and colleagues wrote in a 2015 article in the journal Cell.\r\n\r\nThis line of thinking has spurred some change.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, the WHO added to its disease classification system the notion of \u201caging-related diseases,\u201d defined as those \u201ccaused by biological processes which persistently lead to the loss of organism\u2019s adaptation and progress in older ages.\u201d Examples include cataracts, atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, sarcopenia (muscle loss), and dementia. Age is also now a big factor in broader health states or conditions that aren\u2019t formally termed diseases, including urinary incontinence, frailty, and falls, the agency notes. But the WHO stopped short of calling aging a disease on its own.\r\n\r\nBy classifying aging as a disease, the fatalistic notion of it being \u201cnatural\u201d would, proponents say, be replaced by greater efforts by you and I to adopt healthy habits and take medications that slow the aging process. Plus there\u2019d be stronger efforts to study and treat aging, with support from federal agencies like the National Institutes of Health, which hands out research grants, and the Food and Drug Administration, which decides what medicines can be prescribed for what conditions. Think of how money and effort pour into researching cancer and other chronic diseases, prescribing treatments to battle against them, and engaging the entire health care and health insurance industries in the effort.\r\n\r\n\u201cWork to develop medicines that could potentially prevent and treat most major diseases is going far slower than it should be because we don\u2019t recognize aging as a medical problem,\u201d argues David Sinclair, PhD, a controversial anti-aging proponent and geneticist at Harvard Medical School and, it should be noted, a \u200b\u200bco-founder of multiple biotechnology companies.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf aging were a treatable condition, then the money would flow into research, innovation, and drug development,\u201d Sinclair says. \u201cRight now, what pharmaceutical or biotech company could go after aging as a condition if it doesn\u2019t exist?\u201d\r\nDownsides to calling aging a disease\r\n\r\nPhilosophically, calling aging a disease implies it can be cured, just as some people are cured of cancer. That portends a future in which people never die. A cynic might say that such hubris insinuates that life as we know it is not as it was meant to be, that the most universal truth in life \u2014 its end \u2014 is just a cosmic glitch or a divine error, depending on your point of view, and one that needs fixing.\r\n\r\nLogically, getting old is normal, not a deviation from the norm, the majority of experts and institutions agree. Even claims that the typical lifespan can be extended to, say, 150 years or more, are viewed as \u201cvery, very unlikely\u201d based on a recent statistical analysis led by Michael Pearce, a doctoral student in statistics at the University of Washington.\r\n\r\nImmortality? Almost surely not in your lifetime.\r\nHow Long Can Humans Really Live?\r\nEither we have a natural shelf life, or mortality plateaus and the sky\u2019s the limit\r\n\r\nelemental.medium.com\r\n\r\n\u201cIf aging is a disease, then all 7.7 billion people on Earth have it, and everyone over the age of 65 has an advanced case,\u201d the writer Joelle Renstrom notes in Slate.\r\n\r\nPractically speaking, there\u2019s already enough stigma and job discrimination associated with aging, says Hoffman, the Case Western bioethicist, even though \u201cmany people remain highly competent and contribute a great deal to society when they are in their eighties and beyond.\u201d\r\n\r\nIndeed, some \u201csuperagers\u201d have 80-year-old brains that remain virtually indistinguishable from those of twentysomethings. And despite the common perception that time makes us inevitably frail and feeble, it\u2019s well established that engaging in physical activity helps ward off chronic pain and other diseases and promotes mobility and overall physical and mental well-being later in life. Your mileage may vary, of course.\r\n\r\nLabeling aging a disease could have the opposite effect that proponents hope for. It could normalize physical or mental decline and foster complacency among aging patients and health care professionals by ignoring or downplaying other important lifestyle choices that can accelerate the aging process, including lack of physical activity but also poor diet, sleep problems, and even retirement, loss of a loved one, and lack of social interaction.\r\n\r\nAn inaccurate, unhealthy, self-fulfilling mindset could sink in: I\u2019m old, so I\u2019m sick, just as expected. After all, aging is a disease!\r\n\r\n\u201cWhile some diseases are more likely to develop in older age, it would be very problematic to adopt the attitude that natural aging is itself a disease,\u201d Hoffman tells me. \u201cThis would reinforce stigmatization and is not accurate.\u201d\r\nEnduring mysteries of aging\r\n\r\nOne reason this debate still exists: Scientists have yet to pin down exactly why and how our bodies age toward dysfunction, vexing questions given that natural selection generally favors survival and reproductive success. The answers, according to various theories, likely involve at least three interacting processes related to senescence, when cells stop dividing to regenerate and rejuvenate skin, muscles, the brain, and other organs and body parts:\r\n\r\n    Cell divisions can cause genetic mutations that build up, degrading cell function.\r\n    Each cell division shortens a chromosome\u2019s protective telomeres, until the cell can no longer divide.\r\n    In their routine work of creating energy, cells also generate waste that can lead to a buildup of damaging molecules.\r\n\r\n\u201cThese changes are neither linear nor consistent, and they are only loosely associated with a person\u2019s age in years,\u201d the World Health Organization explains.\r\n\r\nWhile aging is inevitable (at least for now) the pace at which any of us ages, or at which certain organs age, is not predetermined nor highly predictable. Several biological, environmental, and social factors, some in our control and some not so much, determine whether and how soon our chronological advancement, on its own or in cahoots with other factors, leads to our demise.\r\n\r\n\u201cAging might predispose to some chronic medical or mental health conditions with other factors playing a much greater role in the disease causation than age alone,\u201d psychiatrist Debanjan Banerjee, MD, and colleagues wrote last year in The Lancet journal.\r\n\r\nThis leads some to emphasize two aspects to aging: primary, intrinsic aging versus secondary or accelerating aging \u2014 that which goes beyond the norm. For example, your skin will age normally, and there\u2019s only so much you can do about it. Spend too much time in the sun, and your skin will age faster, wrinkle sooner, and possibly develop deadly cancer.\r\n\r\nThis much is clear: People and the cells inside them age at different rates, based on everything from their initial genetic makeup to their physical, social, and family environments to health habits and lifestyle choices, and even whether they fear or embrace getting older.\r\nPushing for change in aging research\r\n\r\nRegardless if aging is ever defined as a disease on its own or not, there are highly practical reasons to study the relationship between biological aging and disease.\r\n\r\nMing Guo, MD, a neurologist and professor of neurology, molecular, and medical pharmacology at UCLA, treats patients with degenerative brain disorders like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s. In 2006, with colleagues, she discovered how two genes do quality control in mitochondria, the energy factories inside cells. The findings led to insights into premature aging and its links to diseases of the brain and body, including cancer, diabetes, and heart disease.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we could pause, delay, or even reverse aging, we would make a significant impact against numerous diseases,\u201d Guo says. \u201cI want to create a higher quality of life over a healthy life span, rather than just prolonging life.\u201d\r\n\r\nGuo sees aging as the natural course of development in humans, as in other animals. \u201cAging as a whole concept is not a disease,\u201d she says in an email.\r\n\r\nBut there\u2019s much room for improvement on the research front. With rare exception, there are no reliable ways to measure premature or accelerated biological aging of the whole body or individual tissues, she explains. By changing policies, without labeling aging as a disease, more funding could flow into research that would allow the identification and treatment of premature aging in certain tissues.\r\n\r\nOne research project on the drawing board, called Targeting Aging with Metformin (TAME), seeks to force such change, Guo points out. It\u2019s aiming for funding from the NIH and approval from the FDA to consider aging not as a disease, but as an \u201cindication\u201d that could be treated. Clinical trials would test the effectiveness on aging of metformin, a drug that was long ago approved by the FDA to treat diabetes.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf aging is made an indication, the TAME Trial will mark a paradigm shift: from treating each age-related medical condition separately, to treating these conditions together, by targeting aging per se,\u201d the project\u2019s website states.\r\nOn the bright side\r\n\r\nThe debate over whether aging is a disease often ignores positive effects of putting some time under one\u2019s belt.\r\n\r\n\u201cAging confers attributes such as a greater sense of satisfaction, greater resilience, subjective well-being, and wisdom,\u201d Banerjee and colleagues wrote in The Lancet. And, they noted, some diseases tend to lessen with age. \u201cIt is evident that various psychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder are much less prevalent in old age than in young age.\u201d\r\n\r\nYears upon years of living add up to one undeniable fact: We\u2019re all growing chronologically older, and on average, older people are much happier than middle-aged individuals.\r\n\r\nIf that\u2019s a disease, it\u2019s one most of us might reasonably look forward to.", "read_by": 0, "liked_by": 0, "photo": "article_photos/aging_blog_photo.jpeg", "created_at": "2022-06-30T01:04:49.385Z", "modified_at": "2022-06-30T01:04:49.385Z", "category": [5]}}, {"model": "blog.articles", "pk": 3, "fields": {"author": 3, "title": "Why an AI researcher shouldn\u2019t be your first data science hire", "slug": "why-an-ai-researcher-shouldnt-be-your-first-data-science-hire", "content": "Many organizations start their data science journeys by overemphasizing AI research and gorging themselves on PhDs in their hiring frenzy. That\u2019s a good idea if:\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re investing in a research division and you\u2019re not planning to ask your researchers what they\u2019ve done for you lately.\r\nYou already know you\u2019re solving a problem that is valuable, important, and known to be impossible to solve with all the existing algorithms out there.\r\nResearch for research\u2019s sake is a high-risk investment and very few companies can afford it, because getting nothing of value out of it is a very real possibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf your goal is to solve business problems, here are a few reasons why the AI researcher should not be your first hire:\r\n\r\nThey\u2019re beginners at your kind of data science.\r\nThey\u2019re not experienced with real-world data.\r\nYou don\u2019t have the right environment for them.\r\nYou haven\u2019t found a good project for them.\r\nRead this paragraph if you\u2019re a researcher: Researchers, I spent a large chunk of my life as one of you, so I have utmost respect for how valuable you can be when you\u2019re directed towards work that respects your skills. The point of this article isn\u2019t to turn employers away from you but to avoid a situation that\u2019s miserable for everyone involved: being hired into an environment that isn\u2019t ready to appreciate the best of what you have to offer. Insist on making employers do their homework to ensure you can flourish in your role.\r\n\r\n#1 \u2014 Researchers are beginners at your kind of data science\r\nThere are 2 different kinds of data science; hire for the one you actually need.\r\n\r\nResearch (e.g. AI research, statistics research, data science research, etc.)\r\nApplied (e.g. AI engineering, applied statistics, applied data science, etc.)\r\nTo use a kitchen analogy, AI research is all about innovating in appliances \u2014 creating blueprints of general-purpose tools for others to use. That\u2019s a very different discipline from applied AI, which is more about innovating in recipes at scale. Applied AI is the one you need if you\u2019re using data to solve a business problem (as opposed to selling a way for others to solve their business problems with data).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich of these are you selling? The right team to hire depends on your answer.\r\nBoth are hugely valuable and important, but expertise in one rarely translates to the other. Sure, research is a great place to find someone smart and hard-working, but be aware that they\u2019ll be learning most of the relevant skills for applied data science on the job. Learn more here.\r\n\r\n#2 \u2014 They\u2019re not experienced with real-world data\r\nAI researchers invent general-purpose algorithms and approaches for others to use. They\u2019re not here to solve your specific problem using your specific data. In fact, while real-world data can make for a nice opportunity to show their inventions in action, it doesn\u2019t take much for data to get too real for researchers\u2019 tastes.\r\n\r\nNo one wants the extra pressure of contending simultaneously with speed-wobbles that come from the solution and from the idiosyncrasies of the data. It\u2019s safer to work with a well-known and well-understood dataset that isn\u2019t full of surprises. That\u2019s why AI researchers favor working with synthetic datasets and benchmark datasets.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe synthetic kind tastes different from the real kind. SOURCE: Pixabay.\r\nSynthetic datasets are simulated (computer-generated from a recipe) to create controlled conditions. AI researchers use them for the same reasons that their labcoat-wearing counterparts prefer not to conduct their experiments on grubby sidewalks. Like the real world itself, real-world data can be very messy in ways that distract from the research question.\r\n\r\nResearchers prefer to avoid real-world data for the same reasons that their labcoat-wearing counterparts prefer not to conduct their experiments on grubby sidewalks.\r\n\r\nThe synthetic dataset\u2019s behavior and intricacies are a familiar friend, so debugging is less nightmarish. Even if the research team moves to the business problem\u2019s live data, they\u2019ll only do that once they\u2019re sure their dataset performs as expected on the synthetic dataset, a mindset that isn\u2019t that far off from unit testing in software engineering.\r\n\r\nBenchmark datasets may be simulated or real-world datasets from past projects that the research community uses to compare results between different research teams. If your algorithm scores 65% on one real-world dataset and mine scores 98% on a different dataset, is my algorithm better than yours? Impossible to say without an apples-to-apples comparison using benchmark data.\r\n\r\nUsing benchmark datasets is like everyone agreeing that they\u2019ll try their microwave prototype out on the same glass of purified water to see who can get it boiling the fastest. Gross, no one is planning to actually serve that water to any customers.\r\n\r\nWhich is not to say all AI researchers dislike real world datasets \u2014 case studies and proofs of concepts are awesome, but you\u2019re developing techniques that work in general, having a sterilized environment gives you fewer causes whose effects you need to battle.\r\n\r\nHaving a sterilized research environment gives you fewer causes whose effects you need to battle.\r\n\r\nBut I digress. My point is that researchers are unlikely to have much experience working with a wide variety of real-world inherited datasets, warts and all, collected without their involvement. Which is exactly the kind of data you\u2019re about to foist on them. Learn more about inherited data here.\r\n\r\n#3 \u2014 You don\u2019t have the right environment for them\r\nChances are that if you\u2019re considering making a researcher your first hire, you don\u2019t yet have the right environment to make good use of them. The one thing that PhD programs have in common is that they force students to specialize.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCE: The Illustrated Guide to a Ph.D. by Matt Might, used with permission.\r\nSpecialists are wonderful and we\u2019d all be in the dark ages without them, but they\u2019re not trained to be what you need most in a data science first hire: a ruthlessly pragmatic generalist.\r\n\r\nThe ideal data science first hire should be a generalist whose passion is doing whatever it takes to make data useful. There\u2019s no approach that\u2019s too mindless or cheap if it gets the job done.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of odd jobs that need doing before your team is ready to be productive. Everything from setting up infrastructure to acquiring data assets to wrangling stakeholders to growing your team. Your ideal hire is someone who\u2019s ready to roll up their sleeves and do whatever needs doing.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, many PhD survivors can\u2019t wait to toss their graduation gowns onto the bonfire and make a radical career change, so the degree itself is not a contraindication for data science. Far from it. But the desire to do research clashes with the requirements of being a first hire in the applied sphere.\r\n\r\n#4 \u2014 You haven\u2019t found a good project for them\r\nDon\u2019t bring researchers in right off the bat. It\u2019s better to wait until your team is developed enough to have figured out that what they need a researcher for.\r\n\r\nResearchers specialize in inventing new ways to solve problems rather than new solutions to problems.\r\n\r\nSince researchers specialize in inventing new ways to solve problems rather than new solutions to problems (the distinction is subtle but important!) you only need their help once you\u2019ve verified that the algorithms needed for solving your problem don\u2019t exist yet. That\u2019s when you turn to researchers for help with inventing them.\r\n\r\nWait till you\u2019ve exhausted all the available tools before hiring someone to build you expensive new ones.\r\n\r\nMost teams won\u2019t know in advance whether the tools for solving their problem exist already, so it makes more sense to do things in the right order: before building yourself that space pen, first check whether a pencil will get the job done. Get started first and if you find that the available off-the-shelf solutions aren\u2019t giving you much love, then you should consider hiring researchers.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\nResearchers only belong outside of a research division if you have appropriate problems for them to solve \u2014 their skillset is creating new algorithms and tests from scratch where an off-the-shelf version doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 otherwise they\u2019ll experience a bleak Sisyphean spiral (which would be entirely your fault, not theirs). Researchers typically spend over a decade in training, which merits at least the respect of not being put to work on completely irrelevant tasks.\r\n\r\nResearchers typically spend over a decade in training, which merits at least the respect of not being put to work on completely irrelevant tasks.\r\n\r\nThe right time to hire researchers to an applied project tends to be after your analysts helped you identify a valuable project and attempts to complete it with applied data scientists have already failed.
